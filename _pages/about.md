I received my B.E. degree from Central South University (CSU) in 2010, and Ph.D. degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)  in 2017 under supervision of Prof. [Chunhong Pan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chunhong_Pan) and Prof. [Bin Fan](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/fanbin/). 

From March 2017 to July 2018, I worked as a Postdoc on medical image analysis at the University of Iowa Health Care (UIHC) under supervision of Prof. [Xiaodong Wu](https://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/faculty-staff/xiaodong-wu) and Prof. [Yusung Kim](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/radiationoncology/cme/profile/yusung-kim). The main study focused on the PET-CT dual-modality image co-segmentation, NSCLC lung cancer therapy response prediction based on deep learning, cancer therapy optimization, etc. 

From December 2018, I am passionate working as an assiatant researcher at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests broadly include compute vision, image process areas, mainly remote sensing image analysis, medical image analysis, image segmentation, graph cuts optimization, image classification and recognition, image feature extraction, object detection, optical character recognition, etc.
